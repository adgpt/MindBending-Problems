# FizzBuzz

## Problem Description:
FizzBuzz is a basic problem where you print numbers in a sequence, but substitute specific numbers based on divisibility rules:
- If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
- If divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
- If divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
- Otherwise, print the number itself.

This exercise is commonly used in coding interviews to test logical thinking and handling of simple conditions.

### Example:
For n = 15, the output should be:
```
1
2 
Fizz 
4 
Buzz 
Fizz 
7 
8 
Fizz 
Buzz 
11 
Fizz 
13 
14 
FizzBuzz
```

## Concepts:
- **Modulo Operation**: This is used to determine if a number is divisible by another (i.e., remainder = 0).
- **Conditionals**: The use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` helps in handling multiple conditions.
